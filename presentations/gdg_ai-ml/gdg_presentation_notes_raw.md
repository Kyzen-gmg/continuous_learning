## Build Habits


## 8 Dimensions of Wellness NIH
- Bagua + Yin/Yang

## Poor Focus
- Use the small habits to gain small wins/build momentum
- DO NOT use small tasks to gain those small wins/build momentum---these are distractions!!!
- Warren Buffet / Prioritization Skills / Time Management skills
- Not enough Americans are budgeting their finances much less taught that. How much less are there of people budgeting their time or again.... taught time budgeting aka time management techniques.
- When giving advice to defensive folks, ask for consent first----IF a no, be a role model in your actions--they speak louder than words anyways.

# 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8. There has been no other point in time where so much opportunity is being made available to us an individual.
The issue here is whether or not they are aware of it, have the communication skills to understand/ask for it... education is great but we need to prioritize teaching emotional intelligence, 7empathy and effective communication
# The glue between the fabric of our society is trust and communication

# Microagressions vs Rascism
https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/san-antonio/news/2021/03/26/asian-american-communities-call-for-more-acknowledgment-of-anti-asian-racism
We are currently at a crossroads where people are stuck in a dichotomy. Is it Rascism or is it all in your head? There's more than 2, it can also be both. 
Majority of what I've seen is because of lack of awareness/education.
Hold space, be mindful and increase your self-awareness. Is the other person having a bad day? Are they stuck in automaticity? IS THIS A ONE OFF and is there a pattern of behavior?
We have to check for the other person's intent and RESPOND accordingly vs reacting. IF we react, we are adding fuel to the fire. Effective/Empathic Communication.

As we grow older, the more we get exposed to more and more human and social constructs that we lost our connection. We have to bake in time away to recover.

# Communication/N-Dimensions
communications. Base 2 vs base 10 vs base 12. Example is bakers dozen
Internal world articulate/encode to physical word using spells/words. Physical medium to the internal world of the other human.
"Internal world" is actually misleading.... We are multi-dimensional beings STUCK in this 3d space we currently define as "reality". With the addition of this illusion we define as "TIME", we live in something called "Space Time"
Field of energy collapses into Matter is where we currently are at in understanding how reality and the universe works. This is extremely interesting to me because we are at a junction where religion/spirituality and modern science meets. There's a saying that Science is only trying to prove what Religions already have known for millenia.

One side of me is spiritual... I'd like to minimize showing off that schizophrenic qualities or say things that would get me into a straight jacket. I see and hear things that aren't in the physical realm but I'll show you how I can play that off and smooth talk that using current technology.

Data with a soul. If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist. 
"I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see."
Connection is why we're here. The ability to feel connected--neurobiologicall, that is why we're here.

Shame - Fear of disconnection, is there something about me that if other people know or see it that I won't be worthy of connection.
Fear - 
Vulnerability - Idea of , in order for connection to happen--we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.
Worthiness - strong sense of love and belonging. "Believe" that they were worth of love and belonging. "Whole-hearted" 
1. Courage - The courage to be imperfect
    - Bravery
2. Compassion - The compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others
3. Connection - Connection as a result of Authenticity. Willingness to let go who they thought who they should be in order to be who they were,
4. Vulnerability - They fully embraced Vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful (We are all sinners). The willingness to do something where there are no guarantees (non-transactional, give without expecting anything in return.) ahahaha. Reasearch is to control and predict. The way to live is vulnerability which is to STOP controlling and predicting.

We numb vulnerability.
- "Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick and we're newly married."
- Initiating Sex with husband/wife
- Being turned down
- Asking someone out
- Getting laid off / Laying off people
- We live in a vulnerable world
- We are the most in-debt, obese, addicted, and medicated adult chort in U.S. history
You cannot selectively numb the emotion.

Bringing the unconcious into concious awareness


base 2 binary, yin/yang
base 8 octal, 8 noblefold path/christianity, 8gb, 16gb, 32gb, 64gb RAM for those no PC savvy
base 10 ten commandments
base 12 astrology, chinese zodiac, calendar, binary x 12hrs in a day, also bakers dozen which is not actually a dozen

Religions have an overarching theme model.
Christ was not a christian
Buddha was not buddhist
Muhammend was not a muslim

I was raised catholic but went against it not due to the religion but the people.
If I had to identifly myself, I'm a hodge podge mostly of:
Taoism
Zen/Mahayana Buddhism----There's different buddhisms, Theravada is known as the selifsh buddhists while Mayahayana encourages helping the community. I align myselef to this school of buddhism thought.
Christian Unitarianism.

All religions try to teach Love as the main teaching which to me is about acceptance and inclusivity.

That was my main gripe with the older catholic generation who I saw that once they stepped out of the church, a majority of them would forget to apply the teachings to their day to day. Not all, just majority. The newer generation seems to have more self-awareness and are generally more mindful.

There's talk I had with one of my mentors, He's a prior Apache Attack helicopter pilot, currently a lt. colonel in the Army finishing his Phd in Computer Science and I'd say a pretty decent hacker. I told him that I see the tech industry to start encouraging employees to go back to church because that's what we severely lack in society nowadays.
