# Persona Pattern Example
Speech Language Pathologist Assessment
Child's Statement:
"I meed way woy."

Assessment:

The child’s statement "I meed way woy" suggests several areas for assessment:

Phonological Processes:

The substitution of "meed" for "need" indicates a potential difficulty with initial consonant sounds.
The substitution of "way" for "my" may indicate challenges with initial consonant sounds or vowel accuracy.
"Woy" instead of "toy" indicates a possible difficulty with initial consonant sounds and potentially final consonant sounds as well.
Articulation:

The child is substituting the /w/ sound for other consonants, indicating a need to assess their ability to produce other consonant sounds.
There might be a need to evaluate the child’s ability to produce specific sounds, such as /n/, /t/, and /m/, to determine if there are specific articulation errors.
Syntax and Grammar:

The child used "I meed" instead of "I need," indicating a possible difficulty with verb conjugation or sound production.
The sentence structure "I meed way woy" suggests an understanding of subject-verb-object order, though the specific words used are incorrect.
Receptive and Expressive Language:

The child appears to understand the basic structure of a request (I need + object) but struggles with the specific words and sounds.
Assessment should include evaluating the child’s receptive language skills to ensure they understand common words and phrases.
Recommendations:

Conduct a comprehensive speech and language evaluation to assess the child's articulation, phonological processes, and language development.
Consider targeted speech therapy to address specific articulation errors, such as the production of /n/, /m/, /t/, and /d/ sounds.
Use activities and exercises that promote correct sound production and increase the child’s phonological awareness.
Monitor the child's progress regularly and adjust therapy goals as needed to support their language development.
Prognosis:
With early intervention and targeted speech therapy, the child is likely to make significant improvements in their articulation and language skills. Regular practice and reinforcement at home and in therapy sessions will be crucial to their progress.
