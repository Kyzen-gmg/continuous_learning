Cybersecurity Program Development for Business: The Essential Planning Guide

# Chapter 4: Management, Governance, and Alignment
## Why Governance Matters
First, what is governance?

My definition is: Governance is the collective set of principle-guided actions that when applied guide a company to the fulfillment of its goals. I use principle-guided actions to distinguish governance from reactive management. I use “applied” to further drive home the idea that governance is something you need to think about, agree on, and consistently apply to get the results you want. These principle-guided actions include a company's strategy, ways to measure success, ways to manage risk, and ways to exercise due care of company assets.

The difference between management and governance is in the “apply” part. The application of governance is what I call management. It is very important to separate the two: Governance is the collective set of principle-guided actions while management is the application of these principle-guided actions into the company's operations.

## Strategy, Steering, and Standards
Meet the three S's: strategy, steering, and standards—the governance triad most often applied when we talk about aligning technology and business. In my view, the three S's apply everywhere there is a need for alignment. We need to think of strategy, steering, and standards applied between cybersecurity and risk appetite. Between technology and business goals. Between risk and reward.

- Strategy
- Steering
- Standards

## Critical Success Factors
What does it take to support the three S's? Why, it's the four C's, of course! competencies, conditions, conduct, and capabilities. Jay Ranade, one of the most prolific authors in the IT governance and cybersecurity fields and an incredibly gifted instructor and mentor, drilled the notion that these four C's represent the critical success factors. He is, of course, right. Moreover, as he repeatedly pointed out, the four C's may not be entirely under your control.


### Competencies
Competencies are the skill sets that we bring to the table. If you're a litigation law firm, a core competency would be engaging as many experienced litigators as you can afford. That's a core competency. Engaging real estate attorneys, as excellent as they may be, will not help you much in litigation.

### Conditions
Conditions are the environments in which competencies exist. Markets can be conditions. Geography can be a condition. Technology can also be a condition, and so can cybersecurity. Jay's point about “not always under your control” is abundantly clear when you think of market conditions.

### Conduct
Conduct refers to the set of actions that we take both within our company and within the conditions we operate in to accomplish our goals. Conduct can be ethical or unethical, legal or illegal, but it can also speak to company culture and work behavior. Conduct can have profound implications on the way you achieve your goal. The term “cost of doing business” hides a lot of conduct decisions within it, as does “risk acceptance.”

### Capabilities
Finally, capabilities. I like to look at capabilities as the set of competencies and the measure of competency throughput. Did I lose you here? Okay. Let's simplify! Think of capabilities as your capacity to generate value. Better? Okay, good! Now, how do you generate value with your capacity? Well, you are competent enough, and have enough bandwidth to apply your competency to value creation. In short, you're capable!

Perhaps the most complex of the four C's, capabilities integrates concepts like capacity, resiliency, agility, and the like. For example, one may ask what are the capabilities of your law firm? The answer can be litigation only, or litigation plus real state plus corporate law. You can further ask, how many litigation cases can you handle at any one time? Or, can your corporate attorneys be leveraged by your litigation department? All of these are capability questions.

## One Word: Alignment
What does alignment look like in practice? At the top level, your business strategy will inevitably determine the functions necessary to achieve it. These business functions, which are a direct consequence of your business strategy, determine the operations of the business. This applies whether you're a business of one or one thousand: business operations must be aligned with business functions, which are themselves the product of business strategy. Therefore, business operations must be aligned with business strategy.

You can write it out like this:
Business strategy (determines): business functions
Business functions (determine): business operations

Therefore:
Business operations (must align with): business strategy

<img src="./cyberDev1.jpg" />

How do you measure all this?  
- You start by clearly setting the goals. You measure your progress toward achieving them by establishing key goal indicators (KGIs).  
- You should also identify and establish what the critical success factors (CSFs) are, and communicate them across the company.  
- Finally, you should be checking if you're on course or not through the establishment of key performance indicators (KPIs).

## The Case for Frameworks
A standard, as per ISO, “is a document that provides requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, processes, and services are fit for their purpose.” You either meet or do not meet a standard. For example, you are either PCI DSS–compliant or you are not.

### Capability Maturity Model Integration
CMMI is all about process and process maturity. What is a process? Good question! It can be anything from software development to service delivery and everything in between. CMMI breaks down the maturity of a process into five levels:  

Level 1 processes are unpredictable, ad hoc, and frequently changing in reaction to events.  
Level 2 processes are repeatable, and if you're lucky, with repeatable results.  
Level 3 processes are defined, they are documented, and are subject to review and improvement.  
Level 4 processes are managed using a variety of reliable metrics.  
Level 5 processes are optimized with a focus on continual improvement.

### Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
COBIT is based on five principles:  

Principle 1: meeting stakeholder needs. An excellent principle, really, leading to the goals cascade: Stakeholder drivers influence their needs. Then, stakeholder needs translate to enterprise goals. Those cascade to IT goals, and IT goals cascade to enabler goals.  
Principle 2 of COBIT: Cover the enterprise end to end. Nothing left out, everybody in the pool.  
Principle 3: Apply a single integrated framework.  
Principle 4: Enable a holistic approach.  
Principle 5: Separate governance from management.


# Chapter 5: Your Cybersecurity Program—A High-Level Overview
Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture in 2005 (second edition in 2011) and in it you will find their “Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument”—a short but very useful survey that, when followed, will provide you with a cultural profile for your company. Their survey assesses a company across six dimensions:

1. Organizational dominant characteristics
2. Organizational leadership
3. Employee management
4. Organizational glue
5. Strategic emphases
6. Criteria of success

Each one of these has four rankings in the spectrum of personal versus controlling, nurturing versus results-minded, teamwork versus conformity, trusting versus policing, humanistic versus efficiency-first, and people-centric versus company-success.

1. Threat Assessment: Who's out to get you? Why? How likely is an attack? How bad can it get?
2. Vulnerability Assessment: How easy is it to get you? What's stopping people from doing it? What tools might they use?
3. Risk Analysis: Combine equal parts of threat assessment and vulnerability assessment. Mix, cook, and serve in the form of risk probability over time and potential business impact.
4. Risk Register: A go-to menu of your risks, listing as much information as possible, including risk type (e.g., what, who, why), evaluation date, description, probability, impact, classification (e.g., low, medium, high), response (e.g., accept, insure, run for the hills), and risk owner (who's on the hook for it?). It's fine to go all in when creating your risk register, but keep in mind that throwing everything and the kitchen sink in a risk register will make it difficult to maintain and update. Think comprehensive, but not overwhelming.
5. Risk Evaluation: Compare your risk analysis to business-specific reality. Deal only with pragmatic, real, and present risk. Avoid paranoid thinking and rabbit holes. To wit: Accept meteor strike as “risk I won't worry about,” and sleep easier.
6. Risk Assessment: Using all of the preceding, identify the issues, rank them, and answer what happens if you stick your head in the sand and ignore them. I like my risk assessments to be short and sweet. For each identified risk, think Name, Rank, and Serial Number. Rank, of course, is the key here. Other than that, that's it. If I want the details, I can always refer back to the source documents.


## Organizational Culture
https://www.ocai-online.com/about-the-Organizational-Culture-Assessment-Instrument-OCAI

### Create Culture (Adhocracy Culture)
This is a dynamic and creative working environment. Employees take risks. Leaders are seen as innovators and risk takers. Experiments and innovation are a way of bonding. Prominence is emphasized. The long-term goal is to grow and create new resources. The availability of new products or services is seen as a success. The organization promotes individual initiative and freedom.

Do new things: create, innovate, envision the future
Transformational Change
Handle discontinuity, change, and risk
Freedom of thought and action, rule-breaking
Thoughtful experimentation, learning from mistakes, failing fast
Roles like entrepreneurs and visionaries
Visionaries inclined toward risk, not afraid of uncertainty
Typical in sectors like technical start-ups, technology-driven industries (communications, sustainability), but also disruptive services like Airbnb, Uber.

### Collaborate Culture (Clan Culture)
This working environment is friendly. People have a lot in common, and it feels like a large family. The leaders are seen as mentors or maybe even father figures. The organization is held together by loyalty and tradition. There is great involvement. They emphasize long-term Human Resource Development. Success is defined within the framework of addressing the needs of the clients and caring for the people. The organization promotes teamwork, participation, and consensus.

Do things together: build teams, people matter
Long-term Change
Commitment, empowerment, cohesion, engagement
Human development
Collective wisdom, long-lasting partnerships, and relationships
Roles like a mentor and a coach
Wary of conflict
Typical in sectors like health care, education, some government agencies, not-for-profits.

### Control Culture (Hierarchy Culture)
This is a formalized and structured workplace. Procedures direct what people do. Leaders are proud of efficiency-based coordination and organization. Keeping the organization functioning smoothly is most crucial. Formal rules and policies keep the organization together. The long-term goals are stability and results, paired with an efficient and smooth execution of tasks. Reliable delivery, continuous planning, and low cost define success. The personnel management has to guarantee work and predictability.

Do things right: eliminate errors
Incremental Change
Attention to details, careful decisions, precise analysis
Increase consistency and reliability, well-informed experts
Better processes and efficiency, routines
Roles like organizers and administrators
Conservative, cautious, logical problem solvers
Typical in sectors like medicine, nuclear power, military, government, banking and insurance, transportation.

### Compete Culture (Market Culture)
This is a results-based workplace that emphasizes targets, deadlines, and getting things done. People are competitive and focused on goals. Leaders are hard drivers, producers, and rivals. They can be tough with high expectations. The emphasis on winning keeps the organization together. Reputation and success are the most important. Long-term focus is on rival activities and reaching goals. Market dominance, achieving your goals, and great metrics are the definitions of success. Competitive prices and market leadership are important. The organizational style is based on competition.

Do things fast: compete, move fast, play to win
Fast Change
Customer satisfaction, attack competitors, shareholder value
Speed: results-right-now, getting things done, achieving goals
Acquire other firms, outsource selected processes,
Deliver results, make fast decisions, solve problems
Leaders are hard-driving, directive, commanding, demanding
Typical of sectors like consultancy, accountancy, sales and marketing, services, manufacturing.

# Chapter 11: Incident-Response Planning
To properly prepare for an incident you need to have in place three things:
1. A business continuity plan.
2. A disaster recovery plan.
3. An incident-response plan.

## Preparing Your Incident-Response Plan
For those businesses that need an in-house team for incident responses, you must also recognize that you will need to provide a complete ecosystem for them to succeed. They will need to report to the chief information security officer (CISO), and have access to the risk management teams, information technology, human resources, legal, and communications departments. The minimum size of an incident-response team will always be two: an incident-response manager and an incident-response engineer. One interfaces with the organization and directs the incident response while the other is deep in the weeds doing forensic and remediation work. The larger the organization, the larger the incident-response team and the more specialized and complex its structure.  

One absolutely critical part of your incident-response plan is a clear definition of communications protocols. Think of this as the who-says-what-to-whom-when part of the plan. This is key. For one, you don't want to instigate a panic among users by screaming through the speakerphones, “Incident Alert! Incident Alert!” And you certainly don't want to broadcast to the bad guys that you have detected an incident. So, avoid emails (they may have been compromised), avoid nonsecure messaging platforms, even unsecured telephone lines that may have been compromised. To the degree possible, stick with personal, one-on-one, need-to-know secure communications.  

The whom in the who-says-what-to-whom-when workflow can be long and dynamic. It will change regularly, and likely involve several third parties like your own insurance company, business vendors, cloud solutions providers, your Internet services providers, and a slew of information technology vendors and their incident-response teams. You may be required to notify law enforcement—my go-to is always the FBI and the local district attorney's office. If you happen to be a multinational, then the list becomes substantially longer since you may need to comply with local regulations on incident reporting country by country. On top of all these, you should consider sharing the information that you have with the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and other industry-specific incident-response organizations.  

## Identifying Incidents
First, you should do your due diligence and select the right SIEM for your environment. They come in all sorts of sizes and flavors, including SIEM-as-a-service options. Second, depending on which system you deploy, you may have to fine-tune it. Make your SIEM too paranoid and every alert issued becomes a ticket to be investigated. But tune it to apathy and you won't be notified until your data center has been pounded into fine silicon dust.  

Once tuned, a good SIEM will be your best friend and cybersecurity partner. You'll be working hand in hand in processing the alerts, creating tickets, documenting trends, correlating with threat intelligence, and escalating to containment and treatment. All this beautifully orchestrated work will also be feeding into your cyberdocumentation tools, which your reporting workflows can use to notify authorities, incident information-sharing organizations, wikis, and late-night glee clubs.  

The catch, of course, is that to reach this level of incident-detection bliss will require not only the right, and properly configured, SIEM choice and the right systems management practices (e.g., documentation, normalization, synchronization, etc.), but the right defense-in-depth strategy to begin with, which—you will recall—is the one that resulted in the deployment of the right controls that are being monitored across your environment in the first place.  

## Containing Incidents
Step one: Heed the advice on the front of your binder! Do not panic! You've got this.  

Step two: Identification. What are you dealing with? What are your detective controls telling you?  

Step three: Analysis. This is elbow-grease work requiring unique skills and specialized tools.  

Step four: Action. Once you know who, how, and what, you need to be ready to take action: Do you want to maintain the evidence for possible future actions (for example, prosecution)? Do you want to get back to operations as soon as possible with little regard to evidence preservation? Do you want to tolerate the infection while you develop workarounds? These are decisions that you should have thought out ahead of time and practiced with both your incident team and your top-level management.  

Let's look more closely at step four, action. To properly contain the incident, you'll need to know three things: who, how, and what.  

Who: Who is behind the attack? Is this an accident? Is this an insider? Is this an act of terrorism? What do the threat feeds say about who's behind it? What is the motive? Understanding the who will help you develop methods of containment and treatment.  

How: What is the attack vector? Malware, and if so, which kind? Is this the result of a virus? A Trojan? A worm? Did someone plug in an infected USB somewhere? Did someone click a link on an email? Was this a “drive-by shooting,” such as malware dropped on a computer while someone was just browsing? Or was the breach perhaps the result of stolen credentials? It may be one or more of these things, or none of them. There could be some entirely other, more unusual way that the attacker used to compromise your systems. Your team will need to identify the how in order to contain it and potentially identify ways to preserve forensic data.  

What was hit? A single end point? Multiple ones? Servers? Applications? Networks? Your forensic people will need to do a detailed end-point analysis on the affected systems to collect evidence. This will include any kind of tracks that the attacker left behind, including a bit-by-bit copy of what is in the volatile memory (not just the permanent storage [e.g., hard disk, SSD, etc.]). They will need to establish the incident timeline: When did the attack start, how did it propagate, what did it leave behind, what are the effects? Part of this process involves highly technical work that may include isolating the malware on a system for observation, or reverse engineering the malware to understand what the code is doing. Once all this is understood, then all systems across the company will need to be forensically verified that they have not been infected as well.  

It bears repeating that in the incident-containment phase, knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. If your company does not have the resident expertise, a panicked executive, or IT person being flooded by alerts, may be tempted to pull the plug of the infected computer, try to use some I-got-it-from-the-Internet-malware-removal-tool, or—worse yet—log in as the administrator to investigate it or call your friend in the FBI.  

## Treating Incidents
The only way to ensure that an infected system has been cured is to go to bare metal. This means that you need to completely and thoroughly wipe the infected system and rebuild it bottom-up from clean installation media. There is no sugarcoating this. If you need to be 99.99 percent sure that the infection is gone, the only way to do it is by burning the box and reinstalling everything new.  

Why only 99.99 percent sure, even after a clean wipe? Because, word on the street has it that some agencies have developed malware that infects the actual hardware itself. Allegedly, this type of malware can infect the BIOS (basic input/output system) of a computer, or certain EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) chips, such that even after you wipe the computer, the malware can reinstall itself.  

Of course, even wiping a single system is a time-consuming exercise. Not only do you need to have the clean installation media at hand, you also need to account for configuration settings, clean backup availability, data synchronization when the system gets reinserted into production, etc. Now, multiply this times the number of infected systems. This is where your disaster recovery planning will shine. Having clean, recent, whole-image backups per system will go a long way toward a rapid recovery.  

## Incident Recovery
First, way before any incident, you must have considered the need for evidence preservation. If you are required to do forensic preservation, then you cannot wipe the infected equipment and rebuild. You'll need replacement gear. Moreover, the documentation needs and requirements for evidence preservation are extensive. Your team will need to be familiar with all the laws and requirements for evidence handling, chain-of-custody documentation, proper evidence gathering. Your best bet is to retain a forensic firm to help you. They will interface with your attorney and your incident-response team, and make sure that all the evidence is taken care of properly.  

Second, your incident-recovery strategy hinges on your known values of MTD, your maximum tolerable downtime, the RPO, your recovery point objective, and the RTO, your recovery time objective. You have documented all of this before any incident, and they have governed your disaster recovery strategy. Here and now is where all this will be tested.  

## Post-Incident Review
There will be incidents and there will be INCIDENTS! Both will require your careful review. People call post-incident review many different things (lessons learned, postmortem, etc.), but no matter what you choose to call it, the review process is essential to the evolution of your cybersecurity program and team skills. To begin with, you need an answer to a whole list of questions, starting with:  

Who's responsible for this outrage? You should be able to answer this with confidence. And yet the question is more complex than it seems. It's not about merely assigning a name to the attacker; it is about building a complete profile. Sometimes getting a name will be impossible. You will still be able to glean quite a bit from the tools used, origin, threat intelligence feeds, and plain old Internet searching. Try to build as good a profile as possible. Understanding your attackers, their motives, and their methods will help you prepare for the next attack.  

Just the facts, ma'am! After the who, you need to document the how, and you need to do it in excruciating detail. You need to know exactly what happened, when it happened, how it happened, what vulnerabilities were exploited, how it was discovered, which alerts were triggered, and which were not. You need all the facts about the incident, in as much detail as possible. This will help you tune your defenses and identify holes in your control deployment.  

Knowing now what you didn't know then, what do you need to change? This is the introspective component of the exercise. You need to look inward and understand how your organization reacted to the incident. Look at everything and leave no stone unturned. How did the incident-response team act? Were procedures followed? Were internal communications effective? Was the response time adequate? Were the response actions timely and adequate? Did you meet MTD, RPO, and RTO targets? How did the executive team support the effort? How did the staff react? How was the IT-cybersecurity partnership performance? Once these questions are answered, you can collectively sit down and tune your incident-response plan such that next time you can perform better.  

How do you stop this from happening again? Having understood the organization's and team's performance, plus all about the incident itself, you need to plug the hole that allowed the incident to occur in the first place. This sounds a lot easier than it is. If the breach was due to a phishing incident, for example, your options may be limited to better email sandbox tuning and targeted cybersecurity awareness training. Neither of those will plug the hole completely. They may narrow it, but there is no guarantee that another member of the staff will not fall victim to such an attack. In which case, you're going back to layered defenses (sandboxing, role authorities, monitoring, training, etc.).  

## Do it All over Again!
As we discussed earlier, cybersecurity program development in general and incident-response planning specifically are living programs. They change over time, they change with your environment, the market, the technology, and they change because you change. You learn, you grow, you adapt.  

The good news is that as you learn, grow, and adapt, you can apply your knowledge, experience, and adaptation to your cybersecurity and incident-response plans. You get a second chance! And, a third, and a fourth… .  

Change is the only constant here, and it represents a wonderful opportunity in keeping your cybersecurity program constantly tuned. Embrace this, and take advantage of it. The alternative is catastrophic: An obsolete cybersecurity and incident-response program are just as bad as not having any.  

# Chapter 12: People
- Succinct. If your message is more than a few sentences, it's too long. Edit it down to your specific point. One point per message. Don't ramble.
- Specific. The message needs to be as specific as possible and it should obey the communications principle of who will do what by when. (If you need more on that, look no further than the book by Tom Hanson and Birgit Zacher Hanson titled Who Will Do What By When? How to Improve Performance, Accountability and Trust with Integrity).
- Meaningful. Why does this message make sense to the recipients? How is it pertinent to their work life?
- Authoritative. What's the associated authority issuing the message? In other words, why should we listen to you?
- Doable. At the end of the day, your message must reflect a call to action that can be achieved. It cannot be aspirational or shoot for the stars. It has to be achievable by the message recipient in a reasonable amount of time and through reasonable effort.

- KGI = key goal indicator = Metric of progress toward achieving your goal.
- CSF = critical success factor = Metric of impact toward achieving your goal.
- KPI = key performance indicator = Metric of course deviation from achieving your goal

Ex:
KGI = $5,000,000/$10,000,000 revenue, 50 percent there!
CSF = “We need two new clients per month.”
    = “We need to increase existing client spend by 10 percent per month.”
KPI = "1 client per month (Actual)"
      "8 percent per month (Actual)"

Why be all formal and keep track of all this?
It's an uphill battle to efficiently and effectively improve something if that something hasn't been measured in the first place.
